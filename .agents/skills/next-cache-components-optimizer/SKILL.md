# next-cache-components-optimizer

Set up an agentic optimization loop that drives a Next.js route from "not instant" to "instant" and keeps it there. The loop is test-driven: encode the goal as a failing `@next/playwright` `instant()` test, work it to green, and ship the test as the regression guard.

## Core Principles

- **Invariant: The Verification Loop**: The static shell must commit immediately upon click/navigation. The proof is an automated check: under a lock that gates dynamic data, the static shell still commits without blocking.
- **The Mechanism: `instant()`**: Use `instant()` assertions as a ruler to verify that the App Shell and `<Suspense>` loading fallbacks commit deterministically.
- **Data & Suspense Placement**: Push dynamic data reads (e.g. user session data, live database queries, external API fetches) down below `<Suspense>` boundaries while caching static page skeletons with `"use cache"`.

## Workflow Sequence

1. **Prerequisites**: Next.js 16+ App Router with `cacheComponents` or Suspense-first boundaries.
2. **Baseline**: Ensure the target route renders and its shell structure is identified.
3. **RED Test**: Write a failing `instant()` E2E test verifying that the shell commits immediately before dynamic data fetching resolves.
4. **Fix & Refactor**:
   - Wrap uncached dynamic data fetchers in `<Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>`.
   - Use `"use cache"` where static or periodic caching is valid.
5. **GREEN Verification**: Run the test to confirm the shell is instant and data streams in smoothly.
6. **Clean Code & Review**: Commit the guard test to prevent future regressions.
