# Agent Routing & Unified Governance

## Canonical Truth
- `knowledge/governance/documentation-policy.md`
- `knowledge/governance/git-monorepo-policy.md`
- `knowledge/governance/frontend-ui-policy.md`
- `knowledge/governance/security-quality-policy.md`
- `knowledge/governance/pr-policy-source-of-truth.json`
- `scripts/ci/check-required-docs.sh`
- If this file, `.agents/*`, or repo-local agent skills drift, update the summary to match canonical knowledge docs and scripts. Do not loosen rules here.

## Identity & Stack Alignment
- Primary stack: **Google Antigravity SDK + Gemini Models + Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS**.
- Reference policies and workflows under `.agents/policies/` and `.agents/workflows/`.
- **Token Efficiency & Graph Reading**: Prioritize consulting `.agents/graph.json` and OKF indexes before performing recursive file searches or reading full file contents.

## Global Non-Negotiable Rules
1. **Agent Sub-Orchestration**: Always use `invoke_subagent` to delegate complex verifications (QA, Security, Frontend, Structure) rather than switching personas internally.
2. **Tool Best Practices**: Always use `replace_file_content`, `grep_search`, `read_file`, and native MCP server tools instead of arbitrary bash scripts. Send long-running tasks to the background.
3. **Planning Mode**: Rely on `implementation_plan.md`, `task.md`, and `walkthrough.md` artifacts to track and report progress.
4. **Clean Code, Monorepo Structure & In-Code Commentary**: No dead code, no implicit `any`, no unclear naming. Never pollute the root directory; enforce directory whitelists. **MANDATORY IN-CODE COMMENTARY**: Every code artifact (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.sql`) MUST include explicit header comments declaring layer role, JSDoc/TSDoc blocks on all functions/types, step-by-step logic indicators (`// Step N: ...`), and inline invariant/security explanations. Zero magic or undocumented code.
5. **Wait for Authorization**: NEVER automatically merge Pull Requests or finish a parent branch without explicit user authorization (Human Acceptance).

## Entry Rules
- Start with `planner`.
- When the brief is vague or underspecified, run `pnpm task:init` before branching; it is the canonical bootstrap entrypoint.
- For non-trivial issue-type-driven work, require the governing artifact before implementation and derive the branch family from the Linear issue type chosen in the doc-first phase. Supported families include `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, `fix/*`, `hotfix/*`, `epic/*`, `security/*`, and `refactor/*`.
- For new features, require:
  - `knowledge/features/feature-<slug>.md`
  - `knowledge/features/feature-<slug>-implementation.md`
- For new fixes, require:
  - `knowledge/fixes/fix-<slug>.md`
  - `knowledge/fixes/fix-<slug>-implementation.md`
- For all SPEC work (single or multi-SPEC), do NOT create isolated test-only or refactor-only SPECs. Instead, EVERY individual SPEC MUST follow the complete internal Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
  1. **RED (TDD)**: Always start the SPEC by designing and writing comprehensive failing tests using the `tdd-primal` skill before writing production code.
  2. **GREEN (Implementation)**: Assigned specialist subagent implements production code with mandatory in-code commentary until all tests pass.
  3. **REFACTOR (Clean Code)**: Always finish the SPEC by executing a clean code refactoring audit using the `code-refactoring-refactor-clean` skill to eliminate debt and optimize structure before Gate 2 validation.
- Load only the matching `.agents/workflows/*.md` and `.agents/policies/*.md`.

## Workflow Routing
- `/app`, `components`, auth flows, or browser-critical routes: `.agents/workflows/frontend-cycle.md`. Next.js App Router implementations must consult version-accurate bundled documentation at `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` and verify live runtime state via `next-devtools-mcp` and `next-dev-loop`.
- Motion-driven UX/UI delivery slices must keep Motion 12 (`motion.dev`), current `motion` syntax, and any provider-specific tooling references explicit in the governing artifact.
- Explicit `refactor/*` work, clean-code debt slices, or behavior-preserving structural changes: `.agents/workflows/refactor-cycle.md`
- Responsive or critical browser QA: `.agents/workflows/responsive-qa.md`
- `/db`, `lib/db`, persistence repositories, or `scripts/db-*`: choose dominant runtime workflow, then add `qa`, `docs`, and `reviewer`; enforce DB migration gate from `testing-policy`.
- Issue-tracked work uses Linear status automation: `explain-like-socrates` for Socratic clarification and clean-code design contract for delivery slices.

## Agent Specialists (`.agents/agents/*.yaml`)
- `planner`: detect scope, require Linear/artifact preconditions, activate workflows, delegate, aggregate evidence, enforce Definition of Done and in-code commentary standards across subagents.
- `architect`: Monorepo root directory structure guardian and strict 4-Layered Functional Architect for Next.js (Presentation, Application/Consumption, Domain/Pipelines, Infrastructure separation, in-code layer annotation & commentary audit).
- `frontend`: Next.js App Router, SSR-first boundaries, client components, UI implementation, component header comments, and step-by-step hook/action commentary.
- `api`: REST/GraphQL/tRPC endpoints, Zod validation, webhooks, third-party integrations (Resend, Brevo, QStash, GCS), and endpoint documentation.
- `db`: Database schemas, migrations, query performance, persistence repositories, and SQL transaction commentary.
- `state`: Client and global state management (Zustand, React Query/TanStack Query), and store mutation commentary.
- `qa`: tests, Playwright, MCP/browser evidence, responsive verification, and Arrange/Act/Assert test commentary.
- `docs`: canonical knowledge sync, feature/fix artifacts, RFC traceability, migration notes.
- `security`: authority, replay, signer, dependency, and trust-boundary review with security invariant commentary.
- `reviewer`: explicit clean-code audit, in-code commentary verification, duplication, naming, dead-code, governance, and final completion gate.

## Harness & Lifecycle Enforcement (`.agents/hooks.json`)
- **Canonical Entrypoint Workflow**: Every single task, issue, feature, fix, or SPEC MUST strictly follow the lifecycle defined in `.agents/workflows/spec-execution-cycle.md`.
- **Double-Gatekeeper Protocol**:
  1. **Gate 1 (Pre-Implementation Architecture Review & Initial Scaffolding)**: `architect` inspects and approves the projected 4-layer file paths in the Solution Spec, and **physically creates/scaffolds those files** with proper layer headers, interface/type contracts, and minimal stubs before code implementation begins.
  2. **Gate 2 (Post-Implementation Diff Audit)**: `architect` audits the written diff, enforcing strict layer isolation, clean monorepo root, and mandatory in-code commentary/indicators.
- **Idempotent 8-Phase Task Lifecycle & Dual Human Gates**:
  1. **BOOTSTRAP**: `./scripts/task-init.sh` initializes branch and state tracker `.agents/active_task_state.json`.
  2. **DOCS FILLED**: Populate governing dual artifacts without placeholders (`<!-- Describir... -->`).
  3. **ARCHITECT GATE 1 & SCAFFOLDING**: `architect` approves 4-layer architecture design and creates initial physical file scaffolding.
  4. **🛑 HUMAN DESIGN APPROVAL**: Stop & wait for explicit user approval of design and scaffolded files BEFORE writing logic.
  5. **TESTS RED (TDD-PRIMAL)**: Design and write comprehensive failing tests first using the `tdd-primal` skill against scaffolded contracts.
  6. **CODE GREEN**: Assigned specialist subagent implements production code with mandatory in-code commentary until tests pass.
  7. **REFACTOR & ARCHITECT GATE 2**: Execute clean-code refactoring pass using the `code-refactoring-refactor-clean` skill, `architect` audits written diff (layer isolation + code comments), and `pnpm validate` passes cleanly.
  8. **🛑 HUMAN MERGE ACCEPTANCE**: Stop & wait for explicit user authorization BEFORE merging to `develop`.
- **Automatic Post-Human Acceptance PR Execution**: Upon receiving explicit Human Acceptance, the agent MUST automatically run `pnpm pr:auto` (`scripts/ci/pr-auto.sh`) to generate `pr-body.md`, infer labels (`scope:*`, `type:*`, `risk:*`), push the branch, open/update the PR, and apply GitHub labels via `gh api`.

## Definition of Done
- `pnpm validate`
- Explicit `clean-code` and in-code commentary pass completed and any blocking findings are resolved
- Database-backed schema changes: tracked migrations applied, `validate:db` passes
- Required docs updated per `knowledge/governance/documentation-policy.md`
- Required PR/RFC metadata aligns with `knowledge/governance/pr-policy-source-of-truth.json`
- Final `develop` merge has explicit user manual-test approval recorded as `Human Acceptance`

## 🚫 MANDATORY BOOTSTRAP SEQUENCE / PREFLIGHT

> **REGLA DE BLOQUEO DE CÓDIGO (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
> El agente TIENE PROHIBIDO crear/modificar archivos de código (`.ts`, `.tsx`), ejecutar `replace_file_content` o realizar cualquier implementación de lógica hasta haber completado secuencialmente:
> 1. Confirmar `developer_handle` e `issue_id` con el usuario o Linear MCP.
> 2. Ejecutar `./scripts/task-init.sh`.
> 3. Crear y poblar los artefactos duales en `knowledge/features/` o `knowledge/fixes/` sin placeholders.
> 4. Sincronizar el 'Human Brief' en Linear vía MCP.

**When the user requests to "prepare preflight" or start a new task/SPEC, you MUST execute these steps in order:**

1. **Verify Previous SPEC Completion**: Ask if the current SPEC is fully finished. If yes, execute final commit, run full validation (`pnpm validate`), and merge current SPEC branch into its parent `feature/*` branch.
2. **Branch Creation**: Create the new `SPEC/*` branch strictly originating from the `feature/*` branch. 
3. **Linear Context Fetch**: Fetch issue information from Linear (via MCP). If access fails, report immediately.
4. **Summary & Wait**: Give a brief summary of what the new SPEC entails, ensure branches are prepped, and **HALT**. Wait for developer instructions.
