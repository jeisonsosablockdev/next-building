# Iconography Rules & Governance

This document establishes the canonical design rules for iconography used across next-building public and private surfaces. Following the shift away from emojis and generic flat icons (SPEC 02), we enforce a custom minimalist SVG approach that aligns with our Glassmorphism and Dark Mode identity.

## 1. Core Principles
* **Minimalism first**: Icons must be constructed with clean, unbroken strokes. Avoid unnecessary complexity, fills, or intricate details.
* **No containment**: Icons float freely. Do not wrap them in solid circles, gradient squares, or opaque bounding boxes unless functionally necessary for a specific UI component (like an active toggle).
* **Semantic accuracy**: Use metaphors that represent our brand. Tokenization is represented by floating prisms/blocks, not puzzle pieces. Growth is represented by sharp, minimalist scaling charts. Flexibility/Speed by lightning bolts.

## 2. Visual Weights & Stroke
* **Standard Stroke**: All primary icons must use `stroke-width="1.5"`.
* **Caps and Joins**: Always use `stroke-linecap="round"` and `stroke-linejoin="round"` to maintain a soft, friendly tech aesthetic.
* **Fill**: The base shape should almost always be `fill="none"`.

## 3. Contrast, Glow & Colors
We use the next-building cyan-purple neon aesthetic to make icons pop against dark `landing-depth-card` or glassmorphic backgrounds.

* **Base Color**: `text-cyan-400` (equivalent to `rgba(34, 211, 238, 1)`).
* **Glow Effect (Drop Shadow)**: Icons must emit a subtle glow to feel "alive". Apply the following class: `drop-shadow-[0_0_8px_rgba(34,211,238,0.4)]`.
* **Dark/Light Mode**: 
  * In Dark Mode (default), the cyan glow provides high contrast against slate/blue-gray dark backgrounds.
  * In Light Mode, fall back to `text-cyan-700` with a reduced or removed drop shadow to maintain accessibility and contrast ratios.

## 4. Code Implementation Example
Always implement icons as inline SVGs or dedicated React components to maintain control over the `currentColor` and tailwind classes.

```tsx
<svg 
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" 
  viewBox="0 0 24 24" 
  fill="none" 
  stroke="currentColor" 
  strokeWidth="1.5" 
  strokeLinecap="round" 
  strokeLinejoin="round" 
  className="h-8 w-8 text-cyan-400 drop-shadow-[0_0_8px_rgba(34,211,238,0.4)]"
>
  <path d="..." />
</svg>
```

## 5. Excluded Patterns
* 🚫 **No emojis** (`🧩`, `📈`, `⚡`) acting as primary UI indicators.
* 🚫 **No solid colored background wrappers** (`bg-gradientPrimary` behind the icon), let the icon glow in the negative space.
* 🚫 **No heavy strokes** (`strokeWidth="2"` or `"3"`) that look bulky.
